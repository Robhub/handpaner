        I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through
        third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol
        (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date

        perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any
        other purpose.

        protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and
        reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
